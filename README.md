Dear Peer Reviewer/Friend/Course 
Instructions for the reviewer

Checkout the code using 'git checkout https://github.com/deepthisandeep/DataCleansingAssignment.git TargetDirectory'

Download the data set, https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Unzip the data set into TargetDirectory and you should see a folder named UCI HAR Dataset in TargetDirectory

Load RStudio and set your working directory using setwd("TargetDirectory")

Load the R script using source("run_analysis.txt")

Alternately, you may load the R file via "run_analysis.R" in RStudio

Run the R script using run_analysis() and after execution of the function has finished, you will see that merged_tidy_data.txt and calculated_tidy_data.txt would have been replaced with the newest outputs.


Thank You!
